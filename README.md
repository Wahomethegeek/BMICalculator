# BMI calculator
I created this calculator with xml Kotlin.
I was learning;
- basics in Kotlin
- Shared preferences in Kotlin.

# Initialising the button
- Added a setOnclick event on the button 
- added a format since whatever the user will inpu will be in float it will change it to 2 decimal places
